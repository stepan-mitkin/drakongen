## Procedure "How to tune PID on a quadcopter"

Parameters:
By Oscar Liang

Algorithm:
Call subroutine: "Prepare"

Subroutine: "Prepare"
Listen
To the motor sound
Remember, PID tuning is subjective!
Backup your current PID values
Switch to Rate Mode (aka Acro Mode)
Make sure your quadcopterâ€™s CG (centre of gravity) is right in the middle
Call subroutine "Set initial values"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "Set initial values"
Set RC rates, super rates and expo
Set default PID values
Lower all the values by at least half
Call subroutine "P on Roll"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Roll"
With good P, the control should feel precise
Loop forever
    Cruise around
    Do some sharp turns
    If not (Does the quad dip to one side (like a wobble)?) and not (Do slow oscillations occur?)
        If Do fast oscilations occur?
            Decrease P on Roll
        Else
            break
    Else
        Increase P on Roll
When P is right, you should get minimum oscillations when doing sharp turns.
Call subroutine "P on Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Pitch"
Loop forever
    Do a split-S (where you move both the throttle and pitch sticks)
    Increase throttle to recover, pay attention to the pitch movement
    If Does the quad pitch up more than it should?
        Increase P on Pitch
    Else
        If not (Do fast oscilations occur?) and not (Are the motors making a twitching sound?)
            break
        Else
            Decrease P on Pitch
The quad feels very responsive and nimble
Call subroutine "TPA"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "TPA"
Loop forever
    Do a punch out
    If Does the quad get oscillations with high throttle?
        Increase TPA
        Do not increase TPA higher than 0.4
    Else
        break
Call subroutine "D on Roll and Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "D on Roll and Pitch"
Loop forever
    Do aggressive maneuvers like flips and rolls
    If not (Does the quad overshoot at the end of the move then bounce back?) and not (Does prop wash happen? (oscillation when you descent))
        If Do fast oscillation happen at the end of a roll or flip?
            Decrease D on the affected axis
        Else
            break
    Else
        Increase D on the affected axis
Note that to eliminate bounces at the end of a flip or roll, you can also use Setpoint Transition
Call subroutine "I on Roll"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Roll"
Loop forever
    Bank your quad to the left and right
    Release stick
    If Is the quad holding the angle well?
        If not (Does the quad have stiff, robotic feeling?) and not (Does the quad have oscilations?)
            break
        Else
            Decrease I on Roll
    Else
        Increase I on Roll
You might want to increase I a bit more on a windy day
Call subroutine "I on Pitch"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Pitch"
Loop forever
    Fly forward, do not increase throttle
    If Does the nose keep the same angle?
        break
    Else
        Increase I on Pitch
Call subroutine "Anti Gravity Gain"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "Anti Gravity Gain"
Loop forever
    Fly in a straight line
    Do some rapid punchouts
    If Does pitch stay at the same angle?
        break
    Else
        Increase Anti Gravity
3 to 5 is a good range
Call subroutine "P on Yaw"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "P on Yaw"
Loop forever
    Spin quickly on the yaw axis
    Stop spinning
    If Does the quad dip one side?
        Increase P on Yaw
    Else
        If Do you get fast oscilations?
            Decrease P on Yaw
        Else
            break
When Yaw P is right the spin should be clean and snappy
Call subroutine "I on Yaw"
End of subroutine

Subroutine: "I on Yaw"
Loop forever
    Fly straight
    Make a turn
    If Is there drift, does the quad slide out?
        Increase I on Yaw
    Else
        break
Yaw I should not be higher than just enough to prevent drift.
