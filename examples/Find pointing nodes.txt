## Procedure "Find pointing nodes"

Algorithm:
Start with an empty list
If node.prev
    For each id in node.prev
        get the prev node by id
        If prev node is poisoned
            break
        Else
            If The parent loop of prev node == parent loop
                add prev node to list
                If list length > 10
                    If extra check
                        fine
                    Else
                        for each hair
                            raise the hair
                            If not (raised?)
                                break
                    break
Return the list
